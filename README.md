# Python List/Loop Exercises
The `challenges.py` file in this repo contains challenges for you. Make a copy of the template repo, clone it down, and have a go!

For each challenge you will be required to write a function. The challenges come with "skeleton" functions for you to modify, including "docstrings" that describe what the function should do. They also come with tests to check your work.

To solve these challenges, you should simply delete the word `pass` from the function, and write your own logic in the function body. No need to modify the names of the functions or the parameters! Leave the docstrings as they are too - it's good practise to use docstrings to document your code.

You can run the command `python run_tests.py` in the terminal to check your work. When you have correctly solved all three challenges, the tests will pass. If you make an error in any of the challenges, the tests will tell you what went wrong. You may need to do a little Googling/thinking to figure out what the error messages mean. 

If you need help interpreting the challenges, or have a bug you can't solve, grab a mentor for help!
